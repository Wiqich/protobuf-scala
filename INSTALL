This is the plugin protoc compiler that outputs a Scala builder code for standard Java output.

To build this package you first have to build Google standard compiler.
Issue 'make install' in its top directory.  Then invoke 'make build' for a plugin and find the binary in ./target directory.

Place the plugin binary somewhere in the PATH; invoke protoc with the parameter --scala_out=OUT_DIR.
