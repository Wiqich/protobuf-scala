This is the plugin protoc compiler that outputs a Scala builder code for standard Java output.

To build this package you first have to build Google standard compiler. Then copy libprotobuf.a and libprotoc.a just built to ./lib directory.
Finally you are ready to invoke 'make build' and find the binary in ./target directory.

Place the plugin binary somewhere in the PATH; invoke protoc with the parameter --scala_out=OUT_DIR.
